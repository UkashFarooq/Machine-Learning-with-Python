    "Sometimes the result of the Bayes' theorem can surprise you . Let's say there is an un-common decease that only 0.1% of the population has it. We develop a test of 99% accuracy for positive and negative result. What is the chance that you have this decease if your test is positive. The answer is only 9% which is much smaller than you may think. The intuition is that even the test looks accurate, it generates more false positive than true positive because the decease is not common. With Bayes' theorem, we can demonstrate why it is only 9%.\n",
